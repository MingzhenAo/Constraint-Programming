Foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisors \textbf{Dr. Pascal Bercher} and \textbf{Dr. Florian Gei√üer}. It is them who give me the opportunity to start my first independent project. As a novice in this field, everything looks new for me, they patiently helped me a lot. Pascal gave me many suggestions in constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) models and the format of my thesis. Florian provided many suggestions in the choices of compiler and solvers. In addition, their feedback pushed me to sharpen my thinking and brought my work to a higher level. What I learned from them is not only the knowledge but also the rigorous attitude to work. Without their help, I cannot finish this project in such a short time.
